	href="/actionscript"
	title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a></td><td>actionscript, flash</td><td>ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe). It is influenced by HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk. ActionScript code is usually converted to bytecode format by a compiler.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/assemblyscript"
	title="AssemblyScript">AssemblyScript</a></td><td>assemblyscript</td><td>AssemblyScript is a TypeScript-based programming language that is optimized for, and statically compiled to, WebAssembly (currently using asc, the reference AssemblyScript compiler). Resembling ECMAScript and JavaScript, but with static typing, the language is developed by the AssemblyScript Project with contributions from the AssemblyScript community.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/ballerina"
	title="Ballerina">Ballerina</a></td><td>ballerina, cloud-native, integration</td><td>Ballerina is an open source general-purpose programming language designed by WSO2 for cloud-era application programmers. It is designed to simplify the creation of integration solutions with built-in features for concurrency, making it ideal for cloud-native development.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clang"
	title="Clang">Clang</a></td><td>clang, compiler, llvm</td><td>Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages, as well as the OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript, CUDA, SYCL, and HIP frameworks. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), supporting most of its compiling flags and unofficial language extensions. It includes a static analyzer, and several code analysis tools. It operates in tandem with the LLVM compiler back end and has been a subproject of LLVM.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clozure"
	title="Clozure CL">Clozure CL</a></td><td>ccl, clozure, common lisp</td><td>Clozure CL (often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp implementation with a long history. It implements the full ANSI Common Lisp standard with several extensions including CLOS MOP, threads, CLOS conditions, and streams. It features a command line development environment and an experimental integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS using the Hemlock editor. CCL offers fast compilation speed, native threads, and a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector. It is open-source, hosted by Clozure Associates, and widely used in software applications such as ITA Software's Airline Reservation System.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/crystal"
	title="Crystal">Crystal</a></td><td>crystal, multi-paradigm, programming language, ruby-like</td><td>Crystal is a high-level general-purpose, object-oriented programming language, designed and developed by Ary Borenszweig, Juan Wajnerman, Brian Cardiff and more than 400 contributors. With syntax inspired by the language Ruby, it is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded. Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm. Crystal is currently in active development. It is released as free and open-source software under the Apache License version 2.0.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/cython"
	title="Cython">Cython</a></td><td>c, c++, compiler, cython, extensions, python</td><td>Cython is an optimising static compiler for both the Python programming language and the extended Cython programming language, making it easy to write C extensions for Python. It allows developers to write Python code that calls and interacts with C or C++ code with efficiency close to that of C.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/datomic"
	title="Datomic">Datomic</a></td><td>ACID, Datalog, NoSQL, datomic, distributed database</td><td>Datomic is a distributed database and implementation of Datalog. It supports ACID transactions, joins, and a logical query language, Datalog. A distinguishing feature of Datomic is its immutable data model where time is a basic feature of data entities, allowing for temporal queries.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/elixir"
	title="Elixir">Elixir</a></td><td>concurrent, distributed, elixir, erlang, functional</td><td>Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. It builds on the Erlang VM, known for creating low-latency, distributed, and fault-tolerant systems. Elixir provides metaprogramming capabilities, allowing developers to extend the language comprehensively, leveraging macros and protocols for polymorphism, enhancing its ability to handle large and complex systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Erlang">Erlang</a></td><td>concurrent, erlang, functional, otp, real-time, telecom</td><td>Erlang is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional high-level programming language, and a garbage-collected runtime system. It is used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems, particularly in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang/OTP includes the runtime system, several ready-to-use components, and design principles for Erlang programs, emphasizing concurrency, distribution, fault-tolerance, and high availability.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/flix"
	title="Flix">Flix</a></td><td>flix</td><td>Flix is a functional, imperative, and logic programming language developed at Aarhus University, with funding from the Independent Research Fund Denmark, and by a community of open source contributors. The Flix language supports algebraic data types, pattern matching, parametric polymorphism, currying, higher-order functions, extensible records, channel and process-based concurrency, and tail call elimination.
