	href="/agda"
	title="Agda">Agda</a></td><td>agda, dependently typed, proof assistant</td><td>Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language and proof assistant, originally developed by Ulf Norell at Chalmers University of Technology. It is built on intuitionistic type theory and offers features such as inductive families, parametrized modules, and mixfix operators. Agda assists in writing and checking proofs with a focus on interactive programming. Unlike other proof assistants like Coq, Agda is distinguished by its lack of a separate tactics language, relying instead on a functional programming style for proofs.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/awk"
	title="AWK">AWK</a></td><td>awk, text processing, unix utilities</td><td>AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and is typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It operates as a filter and is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. AWK is recognized for its terseness and power in text processing, facilitating one-liner programs.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/boo"
	title="Boo">Boo</a></td><td>boo</td><td>Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c"
	title="C">C</a></td><td>c, general-purpose, imperative, procedural, structured, systems programming</td><td>C (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most influential programming languages, foundational in developing operating systems, system software, and various applications. C's design reflects the capabilities of targeted CPUs and is especially prevalent in systems programming, including operating system kernels, device drivers, and protocol stacks. It is portable and commonly used across computer architectures, from supercomputers to microcontrollers.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clean"
	title="Clean">Clean</a></td><td>clean, functional programming, uniqueness typing</td><td>Clean is a general-purpose purely functional programming language designed for real-world applications. It is known for its uniqueness typing, dynamic typing, generic functions, and lazy evaluation. Developed since 1987 by the Software Technology Research Group of Radboud University Nijmegen, Clean shares many properties with Haskell, offering an efficient compilation to machine code with its unique type system.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/cmake"
	title="CMake">CMake</a></td><td>CMake, build automation, build system, compiler-independent, cross-platform, open-source, software development</td><td>CMake is a cross-platform, open-source tool that employs a compiler-independent method to build, test, and package software. It was developed as a response to the need for a cross-platform build environment for the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) and is distributed under the BSD-3-Clause License.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/curry"
	title="Curry">Curry</a></td><td>curry, declarative, functional, logic, programming</td><td>Curry is a declarative programming language that uniquely integrates features of functional and logic programming paradigms. It supports non-deterministic computations, constraint programming, and combines features such as lazy evaluation and strong typing. Curry is based on Haskell but extends it with logic programming features.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/dart"
	title="Dart">Dart</a></td><td>dart, google, language, programming</td><td>Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. It is used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications, supporting a broad range of platforms with efficient compilation techniques including JavaScript and WebAssembly.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Elvish">Elvish</a></td><td>elvish, interactive, scripting, shell</td><td>Elvish is a powerful scripting language and versatile interactive shell, offering a rich programming environment with structured data and functional features. It supports cross-platform compatibility with a statically linked binary for Linux, BSDs, macOS, and Windows.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/euphoria"
	title="Euphoria">Euphoria</a></td><td>euphoria, open source, programming language</td><td>Euphoria is a powerful yet easy-to-learn programming language that emphasizes simplicity and readability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications across Windows, Linux, macOS, and BSD. It was first released in 1993 as shareware and has evolved over time into an open-source community-driven project. Its design focuses on rapid development and performance, incorporating features like an interpreter, C translator, and simple syntax using English keywords.</td></tr><tr><td><a
