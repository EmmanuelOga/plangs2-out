	title="Agda">Agda</a></td><td>agda, dependently typed, proof assistant</td><td>Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language and proof assistant, originally developed by Ulf Norell at Chalmers University of Technology. It is built on intuitionistic type theory and offers features such as inductive families, parametrized modules, and mixfix operators. Agda assists in writing and checking proofs with a focus on interactive programming. Unlike other proof assistants like Coq, Agda is distinguished by its lack of a separate tactics language, relying instead on a functional programming style for proofs.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Boo">Boo</a></td><td>boo</td><td>Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c++"
	title="C++">C++</a></td><td>c++, cplusplus, cpp</td><td>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. Designed initially as an extension of the C programming language in 1985, C++ incorporates object-oriented, generic, and functional features alongside facilities for low-level memory manipulation. The language is widely used in systems programming, and resource-constrained software, such as operating systems and embedded systems, due to its performance and flexibility. C++ is standardized by ISO, with its latest iteration, C++23 (ISO/IEC 14882:2024), continuing to expand its features and library.</td></tr><tr><td><a

It provides an engaging interface where students can learn text-based programming in languages such as Python, Blockly, and CoffeeScript, while also gaining an understanding of fundamental computer science and mathematics concepts. The platform, initially developed by Jonathan Schor, Ido Schor, and Yishai Pinchover, was first released in 2014 with support from the Center for Educational Technology in Israel.</td></tr><tr><td><a

With syntax inspired by the language Ruby, it is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded. Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm. Crystal is currently in active development.

	title="Futhark">Futhark</a></td><td>futhark</td><td>Futhark is a multi-paradigm, high-level, functional, data-parallel, array programming language. It is a dialect of the language ML, originally developed at the University of Copenhagen, specifically at the Department of Computer Science (DIKU) as part of the HIPERFIT project. Focusing on enabling data parallel programs written in a functional style to be executed with high performance on massively parallel hardware, especially GPUs, Futhark is influenced by languages such as APL, Haskell, and NESL. It features a strongly optimizing ahead-of-time compiler that can generate either GPU code via CUDA and OpenCL or multi-threaded CPU code. Designed with an indentation-insensitive syntax derived from OCaml, Standard ML, and Haskell, it employs a Hindley-Milner-type system with extensions such as uniqueness types and size-dependent types. The language supports automatic differentiation and regular nested data parallelism while ensuring purity through a uniqueness type system. Although Futhark is not meant to replace general-purpose languages, it excels in compute-intensive parts of an application and is able to integrate seamlessly with non-Futhark code.</td></tr><tr><td><a
