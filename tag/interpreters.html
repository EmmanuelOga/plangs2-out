	title="Zig">Zig</a></td><td>zig</td><td>Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. It is intended to serve as a successor to the C language, focusing on robustness, simplicity, and maintainability without hidden control flows or macros. Zig allows seamless integration with C/C++ and aims to provide better performance and safety features compared to traditional C, with manual memory management and optional types. The language is open-source and backed by the Zig Software Foundation.</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div
