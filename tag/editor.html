	title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a></td><td>actionscript, flash</td><td>ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe). It is influenced by HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk. ActionScript code is usually converted to bytecode format by a compiler.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/apl"
	title="APL">APL</a></td><td>apl, array programming</td><td>APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/awk"
	title="AWK">AWK</a></td><td>awk, text processing, unix utilities</td><td>AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and is typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It operates as a filter and is a standard feature of most Unix-like operating systems. AWK is recognized for its terseness and power in text processing, facilitating one-liner programs.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/bash"
	title="Bash">Bash</a></td><td>bash, bourne-again</td><td>Bash, short for Bourne-Again SHell, is a shell and command language supported by the Free Software Foundation. It was first developed for the GNU Project by Brian Fox in 1989 as a free alternative to the Bourne Shell. Bash has become widely adopted as the default shell for many Linux distributions and is available on most modern operating systems. It incorporates features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh) and is POSIX-compliant, making it compatible with many Bourne shell scripts.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Clozure CL">Clozure CL</a></td><td>ccl, clozure, common lisp</td><td>Clozure CL (often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp implementation with a long history. It implements the full ANSI Common Lisp standard with several extensions including CLOS MOP, threads, CLOS conditions, and streams. It features a command line development environment and an experimental integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS using the Hemlock editor. CCL offers fast compilation speed, native threads, and a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector. It is open-source, hosted by Clozure Associates, and widely used in software applications such as ITA Software's Airline Reservation System.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	href="/forth"
	title="Forth">Forth</a></td><td>concatenative, forth, procedural, reflective, stack-oriented</td><td>Forth is a stack-oriented programming language and interactive integrated development environment designed by Charles H. &quot;Chuck&quot; Moore and first introduced in 1970. The language's unique feature is its ability to extend itself at runtime, making it quite flexible and powerful. Commonly used in embedded systems, spaceflight applications, and boot loaders, it is known for its efficiency and small memory footprint. Forth combines a compiler with an interactive command shell and relies on Reverse Polish Notation.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/inform"
	title="Inform">Inform</a></td><td>inform, inform 7, interactive fiction</td><td>Inform is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson. It allows authors to create stories that operate through natural language sentences and can compile to platforms that support the Z-code or Glulx virtual machines. Inform's significant redesigns include Inform 6 and Inform 7, which supports natural language-based story writing.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/lisp"
	title="Lisp">Lisp</a></td><td>lisp</td><td>Lisp (historically LISP, an abbreviation of &quot;list processing&quot;) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in the late 1950s, it is the second-oldest high-level programming language still in common use, after Fortran. Lisp has changed since its early days, and many dialects have existed over its history. Today, the best-known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp, Scheme, Racket, and Clojure.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/lua"
	title="Lua">Lua</a></td><td>lua</td><td>Lua (/ˈluːə/ LOO-ə; from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed mainly for embedded use in applications. Lua is cross-platform software, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C application programming interface (API) to embed it into applications.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Rust">Rust</a></td><td>concurrency, memory safety, programming, rust, systems programming</td><td>Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its &quot;borrow checker&quot; tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compiling.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Scratch">Scratch</a></td><td>scratch</td><td>Scratch is a high-level, block-based visual programming language and website aimed primarily at children as an educational tool, with a target audience of ages 8 to 16. Users on the site can create projects on the website using a block-like interface. Scratch is conceived and designed through collaborative National Science Foundation grants awarded to Mitchel Resnick and Yasmin Kafai. Scratch is developed by the MIT Media Lab and has been translated into over 70 languages, being used globally. It's widely taught and used in after-school centers, schools, and colleges. As of February 2023, over 123 million projects were shared by over 103 million users, with over 800 million total projects ever created and over 95 million visitors monthly to the website.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="sed">sed</a></td><td>sed, stream editor</td><td>sed (&quot;stream editor&quot;) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. It was developed in the early 1970s by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed (&quot;editor&quot;, 1971) and the earlier qed (&quot;quick editor&quot;, 1965–66). It was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains widely used for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and &quot;stream editing&quot; include AWK and Perl.</td></tr><tr><td><a

The term now refers to the system of extensions - which includes software programs called TeX engines, sets of TeX macros, and packages which provide extra typesetting functionality - built around the original TeX language. TeX is a popular means of typesetting complex mathematical formulae; it has been noted as one of the most sophisticated digital typographical systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a

Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0. Along with C# and F#, it is one of the three main languages targeting the .NET ecosystem. Microsoft's integrated development environment for Visual Basic is Visual Studio, and it is often used in conjunction with the Windows Forms GUI library to create desktop applications for Windows.</td></tr><tr><td><a
