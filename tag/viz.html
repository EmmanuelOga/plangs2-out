	title="Ada">Ada</a></td><td>ada, concurrency, design by contract, high-level, object-oriented, systems programming</td><td>Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, and object-oriented high-level programming language, inspired by Pascal. It features built-in support for design by contract, strong typing, concurrency, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism. Ada is primarily used in systems where safety and reliability are crucial, such as in avionics and other mission-critical systems. It is standardized internationally by ISO/IEC.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/apl"
	title="APL">APL</a></td><td>apl, array programming</td><td>APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c++"
	title="C++">C++</a></td><td>c++, cplusplus, cpp</td><td>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. Designed initially as an extension of the C programming language in 1985, C++ incorporates object-oriented, generic, and functional features alongside facilities for low-level memory manipulation. The language is widely used in systems programming, and resource-constrained software, such as operating systems and embedded systems, due to its performance and flexibility. C++ is standardized by ISO, with its latest iteration, C++23 (ISO/IEC 14882:2024), continuing to expand its features and library.</td></tr><tr><td><a

C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="C">C</a></td><td>c, general-purpose, imperative, procedural, structured, systems programming</td><td>C (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most influential programming languages, foundational in developing operating systems, system software, and various applications. C's design reflects the capabilities of targeted CPUs and is especially prevalent in systems programming, including operating system kernels, device drivers, and protocol stacks. It is portable and commonly used across computer architectures, from supercomputers to microcontrollers.</td></tr><tr><td><a
