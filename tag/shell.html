Julia's distinctive design features include a type system with parametric polymorphism, multiple dispatch as a core programming paradigm, a just-in-time compiler with support for ahead-of-time compilation, and efficient garbage collection. The language also provides strong support for parallel and distributed computing, and has a built-in package manager and extensive interoperability with other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a

It was originally based on the Bourne shell and includes features from the C shell, following requests from Bell Labs users. KornShell is compatible with the Bourne shell and supports POSIX standard compliance. Key features include command line editing, job control, command history, associative arrays, arithmetic operations, and object-oriented programming structures. The shell has undergone numerous adaptations and licensing changes over time, and it remains widely used today across Unix-like systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a

It is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and its syntax is more concise thanks to type inference. Kotlin primarily targets the JVM, but it also compiles to JavaScript for front-end web applications and native code via LLVM for iOS apps. Language development is led by JetBrains, and the Kotlin Foundation oversees the Kotlin trademark.</td></tr><tr><td><a

LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) that serves as a portable, high-level assembly language that can be optimized with a variety of transformations over multiple passes. The name LLVM originally stood for Low Level Virtual Machine, though the project has expanded and the name is no longer officially an initialism.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="sed">sed</a></td><td>sed, stream editor</td><td>sed (&quot;stream editor&quot;) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text, using a simple, compact programming language. It was developed in the early 1970s by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs, and is available today for most operating systems. sed was based on the scripting features of the interactive editor ed (&quot;editor&quot;, 1971) and the earlier qed (&quot;quick editor&quot;, 1965–66). It was one of the earliest tools to support regular expressions, and remains widely used for text processing, most notably with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext string manipulation and &quot;stream editing&quot; include AWK and Perl.</td></tr><tr><td><a
