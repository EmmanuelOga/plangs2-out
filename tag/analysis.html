	title="APL">APL</a></td><td>apl, array programming</td><td>APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clang"
	title="Clang">Clang</a></td><td>clang, compiler, llvm</td><td>Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages, as well as the OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript, CUDA, SYCL, and HIP frameworks. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), supporting most of its compiling flags and unofficial language extensions. It includes a static analyzer, and several code analysis tools. It operates in tandem with the LLVM compiler back end and has been a subproject of LLVM.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/d"
	title="D">D</a></td><td>d language, d programming, dlang</td><td>D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is now a very different language. As it has developed, it has drawn inspiration from other high-level programming languages. Notably, it has been influenced by Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Julia">Julia</a></td><td>data science, julia, machine learning, numerical computing</td><td>Julia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing, as well as a variety of other applications such as data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, modeling, and simulation. Julia's distinctive design features include a type system with parametric polymorphism, multiple dispatch as a core programming paradigm, a just-in-time compiler with support for ahead-of-time compilation, and efficient garbage collection. The language also provides strong support for parallel and distributed computing, and has a built-in package manager and extensive interoperability with other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/k"
	title="K">K</a></td><td>kdb, kdb+</td><td>K is a proprietary array processing programming language developed by Arthur Whitney and commercialized by Kx Systems. K is the foundation for kdb+, an in-memory, column-based database, and other financial products. Introduced in 1993, K is influenced by APL and Scheme, and is noted for its speed, powerful array handling capabilities, and concise syntax.</td></tr><tr><td><a
