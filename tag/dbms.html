	title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a></td><td>actionscript, flash</td><td>ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe). It is influenced by HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk. ActionScript code is usually converted to bytecode format by a compiler.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Ada">Ada</a></td><td>ada, concurrency, design by contract, high-level, object-oriented, systems programming</td><td>Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, and object-oriented high-level programming language, inspired by Pascal. It features built-in support for design by contract, strong typing, concurrency, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and non-determinism. Ada is primarily used in systems where safety and reliability are crucial, such as in avionics and other mission-critical systems. It is standardized internationally by ISO/IEC.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/apl"
	title="APL">APL</a></td><td>apl, array programming</td><td>APL (named after the book A Programming Language) is a programming language developed in the 1960s by Kenneth E. Iverson. Its central datatype is the multidimensional array. It uses a large range of special graphic symbols to represent most functions and operators, leading to very concise code. It has been an important influence on the development of concept modeling, spreadsheets, functional programming, and computer math packages. It has also inspired several other programming languages.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c-sharp"
	title="C#">C#</a></td><td>c#, c-sharp, csharp, dotnet</td><td>C# (/ˌsiː ˈʃɑːrp/ see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/ciao"
	title="Ciao">Ciao</a></td><td>ciao, constraint, logic, programming, prolog</td><td>Ciao is a modern Prolog implementation that builds up from a logic-based simple kernel designed to be portable, extensible, and modular. It supports logic, constraint, functional, higher-order, and object-oriented programming styles.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="ColdFusion">ColdFusion</a></td><td>adobe, cfml, coldfusion, rapid development</td><td>Adobe ColdFusion is a commercial rapid web-application development computing platform created by J. J. Allaire in 1995. The programming language used with the platform is known as CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language). ColdFusion was initially designed to simplify connecting HTML pages to a database, and quickly evolved into a comprehensive platform featuring a full scripting language and an integrated development environment (IDE).</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/datalog"
	title="Datalog">Datalog</a></td><td>datalog, declarative, deductive databases, logic programming, query language</td><td>Datalog is a declarative logic programming language that serves as a syntactic subset of Prolog, using a bottom-up evaluation model to deduce facts. It is extensively used as a query language for deductive databases, aiding in data integration, networking, program analysis, and more.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Datomic">Datomic</a></td><td>ACID, Datalog, NoSQL, datomic, distributed database</td><td>Datomic is a distributed database and implementation of Datalog. It supports ACID transactions, joins, and a logical query language, Datalog. A distinguishing feature of Datomic is its immutable data model where time is a basic feature of data entities, allowing for temporal queries.</td></tr><tr><td><a

It was first released in 1993 as shareware and has evolved over time into an open-source community-driven project. Its design focuses on rapid development and performance, incorporating features like an interpreter, C translator, and simple syntax using English keywords.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Forth">Forth</a></td><td>concatenative, forth, procedural, reflective, stack-oriented</td><td>Forth is a stack-oriented programming language and interactive integrated development environment designed by Charles H. &quot;Chuck&quot; Moore and first introduced in 1970. The language's unique feature is its ability to extend itself at runtime, making it quite flexible and powerful. Commonly used in embedded systems, spaceflight applications, and boot loaders, it is known for its efficiency and small memory footprint. Forth combines a compiler with an interactive command shell and relies on Reverse Polish Notation.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Go">Go</a></td><td>go, golang</td><td>Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but offers memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Sometimes referred to as Golang due to its former domain name golang.org, its proper name is Go. It is suitable for building scalable, simple, and secure systems.</td></tr><tr><td><a
