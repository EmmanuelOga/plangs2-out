	title="ActionScript">ActionScript</a></td><td>actionscript, flash</td><td>ActionScript is an object-oriented programming language originally developed by Macromedia Inc. (later acquired by Adobe). It is influenced by HyperTalk, the scripting language for HyperCard. It is now an implementation of ECMAScript (meaning it is a superset of the syntax and semantics of the language more widely known as JavaScript), though it originally arose as a sibling, both being influenced by HyperTalk. ActionScript code is usually converted to bytecode format by a compiler.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/basic"
	title="BASIC">BASIC</a></td><td>BASIC, beginners' all-purpose symbolic instruction code, historical, language, programming</td><td>BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming languages designed for ease of use. The original version was created by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz at Dartmouth College in 1964. They aimed to enable students in non-scientific fields to use computers, making programming more accessible.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	href="/boo"
	title="Boo">Boo</a></td><td>boo</td><td>Boo is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language that seeks to make use of the Common Language Infrastructure's support for Unicode, internationalization, and web applications, while using a Python-inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility. Some features of note include type inference, generators, multimethods, optional duck typing, macros, true closures, currying, and first-class functions.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c++"
	title="C++">C++</a></td><td>c++, cplusplus, cpp</td><td>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup. Designed initially as an extension of the C programming language in 1985, C++ incorporates object-oriented, generic, and functional features alongside facilities for low-level memory manipulation. The language is widely used in systems programming, and resource-constrained software, such as operating systems and embedded systems, due to its performance and flexibility. C++ is standardized by ISO, with its latest iteration, C++23 (ISO/IEC 14882:2024), continuing to expand its features and library.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="C#">C#</a></td><td>c#, c-sharp, csharp, dotnet</td><td>C# (/ˌsiː ˈʃɑːrp/ see SHARP) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Clojure">Clojure</a></td><td>clojure</td><td>Clojure (/ˈkloʊʒər/, like closure) is a dynamic, general-purpose programming language, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming. It is known for its expressiveness, immutability, and concurrency.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="CodeMonkey">CodeMonkey</a></td><td>codemonkey, coding, education, game-based learning, kids, programming</td><td>CodeMonkey is an educational computer coding environment designed to teach programming concepts and languages to beginners, specifically students aged 6-14. It provides an engaging interface where students can learn text-based programming in languages such as Python, Blockly, and CoffeeScript, while also gaining an understanding of fundamental computer science and mathematics concepts. The platform, initially developed by Jonathan Schor, Ido Schor, and Yishai Pinchover, was first released in 2014 with support from the Center for Educational Technology in Israel.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="D">D</a></td><td>d language, d programming, dlang</td><td>D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is now a very different language. As it has developed, it has drawn inspiration from other high-level programming languages. Notably, it has been influenced by Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/forth"
	title="Forth">Forth</a></td><td>concatenative, forth, procedural, reflective, stack-oriented</td><td>Forth is a stack-oriented programming language and interactive integrated development environment designed by Charles H. &quot;Chuck&quot; Moore and first introduced in 1970. The language's unique feature is its ability to extend itself at runtime, making it quite flexible and powerful. Commonly used in embedded systems, spaceflight applications, and boot loaders, it is known for its efficiency and small memory footprint. Forth combines a compiler with an interactive command shell and relies on Reverse Polish Notation.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	href="/inform"
	title="Inform">Inform</a></td><td>inform, inform 7, interactive fiction</td><td>Inform is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson. It allows authors to create stories that operate through natural language sentences and can compile to platforms that support the Z-code or Glulx virtual machines. Inform's significant redesigns include Inform 6 and Inform 7, which supports natural language-based story writing.</td></tr><tr><td><a
