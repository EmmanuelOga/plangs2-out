Microsoft launched VB.NET in 2002 as the successor to its original Visual Basic language, the last version of which was Visual Basic 6.0. Along with C# and F#, it is one of the three main languages targeting the .NET ecosystem. Microsoft's integrated development environment for Visual Basic is Visual Studio, and it is often used in conjunction with the Windows Forms GUI library to create desktop applications for Windows.</td></tr><tr><td><a

Applications written in vvvv are commonly called patches. Patches consist of a network of vertices and can be created, edited, and tested while they are running. Patches are stored on disk in standard XML format. vvvv is written in Borland Delphi, and plugins can be developed in the .NET Framework in C#.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Zig">Zig</a></td><td>zig</td><td>Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. It is intended to serve as a successor to the C language, focusing on robustness, simplicity, and maintainability without hidden control flows or macros. Zig allows seamless integration with C/C++ and aims to provide better performance and safety features compared to traditional C, with manual memory management and optional types. The language is open-source and backed by the Zig Software Foundation.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></article></main></div></body></html>
