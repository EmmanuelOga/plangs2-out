The language is developed by the XML Query working group of the W3C. The work is closely coordinated with the development of XSLT by the XSL Working Group; the two groups share responsibility for XPath, which is a subset of XQuery.</td></tr><tr><td><a

It offers additional functionality such as type inference, extension methods, and operator overloading. Xtend integrates seamlessly with existing Java libraries and supports features known from functional programming like lambda expressions. Developed by typefox and first released in 2011, Xtend compiles to Java code and ensures compatibility with Java's type system, making it accessible for Java developers. It is open source under the Eclipse Public License.</td></tr><tr><td><a

	title="Zig">Zig</a></td><td>zig</td><td>Zig is an imperative, general-purpose, statically typed, compiled system programming language designed by Andrew Kelley. It is intended to serve as a successor to the C language, focusing on robustness, simplicity, and maintainability without hidden control flows or macros. Zig allows seamless integration with C/C++ and aims to provide better performance and safety features compared to traditional C, with manual memory management and optional types. The language is open-source and backed by the Zig Software Foundation.</td></tr></tbody></table></div></article></main></div></body></html>
