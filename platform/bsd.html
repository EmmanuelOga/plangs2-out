	href="/bash"
	title="Bash">Bash</a></td><td>bash, bourne-again</td><td>Bash, short for Bourne-Again SHell, is a shell and command language supported by the Free Software Foundation. It was first developed for the GNU Project by Brian Fox in 1989 as a free alternative to the Bourne Shell. Bash has become widely adopted as the default shell for many Linux distributions and is available on most modern operating systems. It incorporates features from the Korn shell (ksh) and the C shell (csh) and is POSIX-compliant, making it compatible with many Bourne shell scripts.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/c"
	title="C">C</a></td><td>c, general-purpose, imperative, procedural, structured, systems programming</td><td>C (pronounced like the letter C) is a general-purpose programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It has become one of the most influential programming languages, foundational in developing operating systems, system software, and various applications. C's design reflects the capabilities of targeted CPUs and is especially prevalent in systems programming, including operating system kernels, device drivers, and protocol stacks. It is portable and commonly used across computer architectures, from supercomputers to microcontrollers.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/ciao"
	title="Ciao">Ciao</a></td><td>ciao, constraint, logic, programming, prolog</td><td>Ciao is a modern Prolog implementation that builds up from a logic-based simple kernel designed to be portable, extensible, and modular. It supports logic, constraint, functional, higher-order, and object-oriented programming styles.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clang"
	title="Clang">Clang</a></td><td>clang, compiler, llvm</td><td>Clang is a compiler front end for the C, C++, Objective-C, and Objective-C++ programming languages, as well as the OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript, CUDA, SYCL, and HIP frameworks. It acts as a drop-in replacement for the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), supporting most of its compiling flags and unofficial language extensions. It includes a static analyzer, and several code analysis tools. It operates in tandem with the LLVM compiler back end and has been a subproject of LLVM.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/clozure"
	title="Clozure CL">Clozure CL</a></td><td>ccl, clozure, common lisp</td><td>Clozure CL (often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp implementation with a long history. It implements the full ANSI Common Lisp standard with several extensions including CLOS MOP, threads, CLOS conditions, and streams. It features a command line development environment and an experimental integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS using the Hemlock editor. CCL offers fast compilation speed, native threads, and a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector. It is open-source, hosted by Clozure Associates, and widely used in software applications such as ITA Software's Airline Reservation System.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/crystal"
	title="Crystal">Crystal</a></td><td>crystal, multi-paradigm, programming language, ruby-like</td><td>Crystal is a high-level general-purpose, object-oriented programming language, designed and developed by Ary Borenszweig, Juan Wajnerman, Brian Cardiff and more than 400 contributors. With syntax inspired by the language Ruby, it is a compiled language with static type-checking, but specifying the types of variables or method arguments is generally unneeded. Types are resolved by an advanced global type inference algorithm. Crystal is currently in active development. It is released as free and open-source software under the Apache License version 2.0.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/d"
	title="D">D</a></td><td>d language, d programming, dlang</td><td>D, also known as dlang, is a multi-paradigm system programming language created by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001. Andrei Alexandrescu joined the design and development effort in 2007. Though it originated as a re-engineering of C++, D is now a very different language. As it has developed, it has drawn inspiration from other high-level programming languages. Notably, it has been influenced by Java, Python, Ruby, C#, and Eiffel.</td></tr><tr><td><a
	href="/eiffel"
	title="Eiffel">Eiffel</a></td><td>bertrand meyer, design by contract, eiffel, object-oriented</td><td>Eiffel is an object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer. It emphasizes software reliability through design by contract, and first appeared in 1986. The language supports multiple inheritance, genericity, polymorphism, encapsulation, and other advanced software engineering concepts. Eiffel is particularly noted for its strong typing and explicit contract design, including preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.</td></tr><tr><td><a
